                <h3>How Women's Football is born</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    It all started when two friends 🤝 attended a Women's Champions League match between Juventus and Bayern. 🏟️ 
                    To our surprise, the stadium was almost empty, with only about 1,000 spectators. 
                    We were impressed by how accessible the experience was: an atmosphere full of passion and dedication, 
                    but lacking the audience it deserved. 💜

                    The next day, an idea was born: to create a platform that would highlight women's football, 
                    giving it the attention and visibility it has long deserved. ⚽✨ 
                    And so, Women's Football was born — a project driven by our shared love for the game 
                    and a commitment to making a difference. 🚀
