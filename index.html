                <p> <span><b>More on us</b></span><br>Women's Football is a project born from the enthusiasm for women's football, a sector 
                    that is still little explored and undervalued. Even though we run this platform in our free time, 
                    our dedication is absolute: we deeply believe that women's football deserves 
                    the same visibility and respect as men's football. We are determined to build 
                    something meaningful and lasting for all fans of the sport.
                    <br><br>
                    <span><b>Our mission</b></span><br>Our mission is to make women's football accessible to everyone, 
                        through an intuitive and innovative platform. We want anyone to 
                        be able to discover the statistics and data of players and teams quickly and easily. 
                        We are here to become the point of reference for those who want to stay up-to-date without complications.
                    <br><br>
                    <span><b>Community</b></span><br>
                        Our goal is to grow together with our community. To this end, we listen to all user 
                        feedback and suggestions, knowing that it is thanks to you that we can continuously improve. 
                        We have lots of new features and improvements in store that will make the 
                        experience on Women's Football even richer and more engaging.
